    <title>AntUnit Task</title>

    <h2><a name="antunit">AntUnit</a></h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Runs Ant on targets of a build file that follow a certain
      naming convention.  If Ant throws the special subclass of
        <code>BuildException</code> that the 
        <a href="assert.html"><code>assertTrue</code></a>
      task uses, consider it a failed test.  Any other exception is
      considered a failure.  If Ant completes the target without any
      exception, consider it a passed test.</p>

    <p>Tests are specified via ResourceCollections.</p>

    <p>All targets whose name starts with "test" (but not if the name
    is "test" exactly) are considered test
    cases.  If a test build file contains a target named setUp, this
    gets executed before each test target.  If it contains a target
    named tearDown this gets executed after each test target.  Each
    test target is run in a fresh ant project.</p>

    <p>So in a build file with targets setUp, tearDown, test1 and
    test2, antunit will run two Ant builds.  One will run the targets
    setUp, test1 and tearDown (in that order), the other one will run
    setUp, test2 and tearDown.  The order of those two Ant builds is
    not defined.</p>

    <p>&lt;antunit&gt; also supports AntUnitListeners, i.e. classes
    that receive notifications on test runs, failures and so one.
    Currently only a single implementation of this interface is
    provided with this ant library.</p>

    <p>Log output during each antunit test case is captured by an
    instance of the LogCapturer class that is available via a project
    reference named ant.antunit.log.  The published interface of that
    class is:</p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>This task doesn't support any attributes.</p>

    <h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

    <h4>any file system resource collection</h4>

    <p>Specifies the build files to run as tests.  At least one
    resource is required.</p>

    <h4>any implementation of AntUnitListener</h4>

    <p>Creates a test listener that gets attached to the task.</p>

    <p>The only listener that is part of this antlib is <a
    href="plainlistener.html">&lt;plainlistener/&gt;</a> this one
    creates reports similar to the "plain" &lt;formatter&gt; of the
    &lt;junit&gt; task.</p>

    <h4>propertyset</h4>

    <p><a
    href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/propertyset.html">&lt;propertyset&gt;</a>s
    can be used to pass properties to the build files under test.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p>This build file snippet (from src/etc/testcases/antunit/base.xml)</p>
<pre>
  &lt;target name="setUp">
    &lt;echo>setup&lt;/echo>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="test1">
    &lt;echo>test1&lt;/echo>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="test2">
    &lt;echo>test2&lt;/echo>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="Xtest3">
    &lt;echo>test3&lt;/echo>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="test4">
    &lt;au:assertTrue message="test4 fails">
      &lt;istrue value="false"/>
    &lt;/au:assertTrue>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="test5">
    &lt;fail message="test5 exits with error"/>
  &lt;/target>

  &lt;target name="tearDown">
    &lt;echo>tearDown&lt;/echo>
  &lt;/target>
</pre>

    <p>together with</p>

<pre>
    &lt;au:antunit>
      &lt;file file="antunit/base.xml"/>
      &lt;au:plainlistener/>
    &lt;/au:antunit>
</pre>

    <p>results in output similar to</p>
